# Goal Tracker App with React Native and TypeScript Integration

This React Native app helps users track and manage their goals. It features a simple and interactive user interface where users can add, view, and delete goals. Built using TypeScript, the app leverages type annotations to enhance code maintainability and developer productivity.

## Key Features:
- **Add Goals:** Users can enter new goals through a modal input.
- **View Goals:** All added goals are displayed in a list format.
- **Delete Goals:** Users can remove goals by tapping on them.
- **Modal and Image Support:** The app uses a modal for goal input and displays an image to enhance visual appeal.

By integrating TypeScript, this project provides the benefits of static typing, which improves code reliability and scalability.
